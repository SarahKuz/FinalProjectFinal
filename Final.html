      <h3>Its been nearly 6 years since Super Storm Sandy hit New York</h3> 

     	 <p> Sandy revealed that much of NYC's infastructure is vulnerable to rising waters and future storms. As the negative effects of climate change continue to plauge our coast lines, one would expect NYC to halt or mitigate its waterfront developments. However, our most low-lying waterfronts, such as Red Hook and Lower-Manhattan, have continued to see massive amounts of development.

      	<h3>If You Build It Will It Flood?</h3>
      
      		<p> As part of the Red Hook Integrated Flood Protection plan (, the city will install a semi-permanent Beard Street barrier wall that will stand four feet tall and protect the neighborhood from future mild storm surge. While the wall wonâ€™t protect against another 100-year storm like Sandy, it will be effective in preventing flooding from a ten-year storm, or less threatening storms.

It can bubble up on the dry side of the wall. We don't understand that fully, but storm surge can push up the groundwater table," which is only 5- to 10-feet below the surface throughout Red Hook.</blockquote>
