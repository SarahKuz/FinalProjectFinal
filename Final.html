	<h3>Its been nearly 6 years since Super Storm Sandy hit New York</h3> 
   	<div class="opening-text"> 
      

     	 <p> Sandy revealed that much of NYC's infastructure is vulnerable to rising waters and future storms. In fact, there were over 90,000 buildings in the flood zones when Sandy hit. As a result there was $23 billion was spent on recovery efforts. As the negative effects of climate change continue to plauge our coast lines, one would expect NYC to halt or mitigate its waterfront developments. However, our most low-lying waterfronts, such as Red Hook and Lower-Manhattan, have continued to see massive amounts of development.

      		<p> As part of the Red Hook Integrated Flood Protection plan the city will install a semi-permanent Beard Street barrier wall that will stand four feet tall and protect the neighborhood from future mild storm surge. While the wall won’t protect against another 100-year storm like Sandy, it will be effective in preventing flooding from a ten-year storm, or less threatening storms.

The shaded area on the map shows the 90th Percentile Projections for a Sea-Level Rise of 11 inches. From this image it is clear that within 100 years the entirety of Red Hook will be underwater, as will a large portion of lower Manhattan.

      			Yet, even with the constant threat of flooding, the low-lying areas of Red Hook and lower Manhattan have seen unprecidented devlopment since the 2012 superstorm. In fact, <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/hurricane-sandy-nyc-five-years-later-city-builds-where-floods-hit-hardest/" target="_blank">according</a> to Grant Long, StreetEasy's senior economist, “The demand for new housing has proven stronger than the memory of Sandy’s destruction.”
      			<blockquote cite="https://streeteasy.com/blog/hurricane-sandy-nyc-five-years-later-city-builds-where-floods-hit-hardest/">  In the six years since  seawater inundated the lobbies of lower Manhattan's luxury apartment towers, <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/hurricane-sandy-nyc-five-years-later-city-builds-where-floods-hit-hardest/" target="_blank">nine</a>  new developments have broken ground in the very same flood zone. Since the storm, <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/hurricane-sandy-nyc-five-years-later-city-builds-where-floods-hit-hardest/" target="_blank">27</a>  new residential buildings have been constructed in Red Hook, with all but two located in flood zones.</blockquote>

    	In the chart above we see the average prices of homes in both Red Hook and Lower Manhattan from 2011 through 2017. The data, from streeteasy open data, clearly shows that after Super Storm Sandy people were not only deterred by inevitable flooding but continued to buy at increased prices.
